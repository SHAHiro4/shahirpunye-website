	<td >The times when a good software product that many will use could be created alone have faded away.
	Therefore, the ability to work in a team is perhaps one of the most important skills now. Take just two
	of the best developers who cannot communicate with each other, constantly argue, and cannot find common ground,
	and you will never finish your project. Extrapolate this problem to a larger team, and you will understand the 
	full importance of this skill.</td>
